Hello! My name is Nicole Reinke and I'm going to Lambda School to become a data scientist. Some non-tech things about me include:

- I'm a mom of 1
- Cat person

What else do you need?

### My story

So, I started out working in retail and realized that wasn't for me. I was looking into learning code (mainly because I saw it come up on my feed) to expand my knowledge into something else. Now aside from my story, thank you for checking out my blog and you can reach out to me on Linked In to let me know your feedback if you want. Stay Amazing :)
